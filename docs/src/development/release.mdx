# Release Guidelines

If you are a developer on the MobX project, here are few guidelines that will help in your journey. These apply to all the packages: `mobx`, `mobx_codegen`, `flutter_mobx`.

### 1. pubspec.yaml

- Use the [semantic versioning policy](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning) to update the version in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Say you are updating from `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`, then update the `version` field in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 0.2.0
```

### 2. Expose version

- Expose the updated version of `pubspec.yaml` to the library `.dart` file by running the appropriate command:

```bash
./tool/expose_version.dart <package_name>
```

There is a handy _npm-script_ called **`set:versions`** inside the root-level `package.json` file. You could run that to update versions in all packages. Note that you do need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for this.

```shell script
npm run set:versions
```

### 3. Changelog

- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file to include the changes introduced in the new version. Normally you would do this by adding a new bullet point for the version and follow the template from earlier versions.
- If the changes are minimal, you can also append the change to an earlier bullet point but include the new version as a range. For example, the changes in `0.3.2+3` were minimal, so we added it as a range from the earlier version.

```markdown
## 0.3.0 - 0.3.2+3
```

### 4. Update the versions in the Getting Started Guide

The versions of packages mentioned in the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) should match the `pubspec.yaml` files of each package.

### 5. Push release tags to Github

Before we can publish to **pub.dev**, it is necessary to push the version tags marking the point in code that corresponds to the version of
the package. You can set the tag using the following git command. This applies to all our packages: `mobx`, `flutter_mobx` and `mobx_codegen`

```shell
git tag mobx-0.4.0
```

Note that the tag-format should be:

**`<name-of-package>-<pubspec-version>`**

### 6. Publish

Run the command `flutter packages pub publish` in the package folder. Assuming you have done all of the earlier steps, this should be just a matter of hitting the `y` key and publishing.

```
$> flutter packages pub publish
Publishing mobx 0.3.3+2 to https://pub.dartlang.org:
...
...
...
...
Looks great! Are you ready to upload your package (y/n)? y
Uploading...
Successfully uploaded package.

```
