# MobX Cheat Sheet ðŸš€

import { PubBadge } from '../components/PubBadge';

## Required Packages

Make sure to have the following packages installed for working effectively with `MobX` and `Flutter`:

1. <PubBadge name={'mobx'} />

The main MobX package that includes `Observables`, `Actions`, and `Reactions`

2. <PubBadge name={'flutter_mobx'} />

Provides the `Observer` widget that auto-renders when the tracked observables change.

3. <PubBadge name={'mobx_codegen'} />

A powerful code-generator that greatly improves the developer experience with MobX. It provides annotations like
`@observable`, `@computed`, `@action` which hides all the boilerplate in a separately generated file, `*.g.dart`.

These packages should appear in your `pubspec.yaml` like below.

```yaml
dependencies:
  mobx: ^0.4.0
  flutter_mobx: ^0.3.6
  mobx_codegen: ^0.4.1
```

## Declaring a Store class

Every store in MobX should be declared with the following boilerplate. This is probably the only boilerplate that
gets repeated. You could make this into a code-snippet in your IDE. Below we are declaring a `Todo` store.

```dart
// todo.dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'todo.g.dart';

class Todo = _Todo with _$Todo;

abstract class _Todo with Store {
  /* rest of the class*/
}
```

> Note that the basename of the _part-file_ must match the _containing-file_ exactly! In the above case, the part
> file is called `todo.g.dart`, which matches the `todo.dart` file in which it is contained.

## Adding `@observable`, `@computed`, `@action`

_Observables_ are the reactive state of your store and _Actions_ are semantic operations that mutate them. _Computed
Observables_ are read-only properties that depend on other observables and auto-update when any of the dependent
observables change.

```dart
// contact.dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'contact.g.dart';

class Contact = _Contact with _$Contact;

abstract class _Contact with Store {
  // highlight-next-line
  @observable
  String firstName;

  // highlight-next-line
  @observable
  String lastName;

  // highlight-next-line
  @computed
  String get fullName() => '$firstName, $lastName';

  ObservableList<String> phoneNumbers = ObservableList.of([]);

  // highlight-next-line
  @action
  void addPhone(String phone) {
    phoneNumbers.add(phone);
  }

  // async action
  // highlight-next-line
  @action
  Future<void> fetchPhoneNumbers() async {
    final numbers = await contactService.fetchFor(firstName, lastName);
    phoneNumbers = ObservableList.of(numbers);
  }
}

```

## Reactive wrappers

MobX also comes with a set of wrapper-classes that add the reactive behavior. These include:

- `ObservableList<T>`
- `ObservableSet<T>`
- `ObservableMap<K,V>`
- `ObservableFuture<T>`
- `ObservableStream<T>`
